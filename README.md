# UniOSScripts
Cool experiments made with C, Python and Bash.
Essentially, these are some of the solutions to the execercises for the OS Course @ Unibo (Prof. Renzo Davoli).

## What is this?
This repo contains many sweet exercises in Python, C and Bash, solved by yours truly and my bro [Adriano Pace](https://github.com/Adrianorieti). 
Some of them are a bit tricky, but fun nonetheless. 

If you can't find the exam pdf inside the respective folder, try to look for it in the full list [here](https://www.cs.unibo.it/~renzo/so/provapratica.shtml)
